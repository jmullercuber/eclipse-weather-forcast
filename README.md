# 2024 North American Eclipse Forecasting

## Why

To help plan trips to view the eclipse.
Inspired by graphic on New York Times.

Currently hard-coded for values for the 2024 North American Eclipse.

## Getting Started

Assumption is that you have Python and Poetry installed on a Debian-based machine.

```sh
# Install python deps
poetry install
```

Various static data sources also need to be downloaded manually for this program to work.
This is a one-time thing. See [the Manual Resources section](#manual-👷) for more information.

## Usage

Run the following in your terminal

```sh
./run.sh
```

View the generated image in the `data/out` directory
